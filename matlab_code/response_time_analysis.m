function st = response_time_analysis
% RESPONSE_TIME_ANALYSIS Analyzes response times by fitting a GLM per subject.
%
%   stats = response_time_analysis
%
%   This function performs the following:
%     1. Loads experimental data using get_data.
%     2. Checks if pre-computed particle filter results ("pfhmm_sealion_timeseries")
%        exist; if not, it computes time-series from the particle filter (pfhmm) for simulated data.
%     3. Uses these pfhmm time-series (volatility, stochasticity, and their standard 
%        deviations) as regressors to fit a GLM on the subjectsâ€™ response times.
%     4. Computes statistical measures (mean, standard error, t-values, p-values) 
%        for the regression coefficients.
%     5. Organizes the results into a table and then plots one of the regression coefficients.
%
%   The function saves and loads intermediate results into/from .mat files for
%   efficiency and reproducibility.
